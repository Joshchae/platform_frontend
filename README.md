# About the project

This app visualizes geographical data on violent conflicts and climate-induced migration using React, Mapbox, Reactstrap, D3 projection and other map libraries. The conflicts page fetches an external API data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) with more than 250000 case entries.
